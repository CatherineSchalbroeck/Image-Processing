## Description
This Image Processing model is built using a Random Forest Classifier model to analyse digit images taken from the MNIST dataset. The model predicts the correct digit in all images.

## How to install
Jupyter Notebook and Python 3 are required to run this model.
The following Python libraries will also need to be installed:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Skimages

## How to use
This model uses MNIST digit images from the Python library Scikit learn.

## Credits
This model was built by myself with the support material provided by **HyperionDev** in my Task assignment.

## License
No license is required.
